# EasyCharge System Overview

This document provides a comprehensive introduction to the EasyCharge system, a command-line electric vehicle charging station management application written in C. It covers the system's purpose, key capabilities, high-level architecture, and core design principles.

### A Personal Note
This project is more than just code to me.
As a first-year Electrical Engineering student, this was my final project for the "Advanced C Programming" course.
While the academic requirement was to build a functional system, I decided to take it a step further.
My goal was to transform a university assignment into a comprehensive, professionally structured, and well-documented project.
I'm uploading it to GitHub as the first step in building a quality portfolio that will accompany me throughout my career.

## System Purpose and Capabilities

EasyCharge is a CLI application that simulates a comprehensive management system for a network of electric vehicle charging stations. The system manages stations, customers, and charging ports through an interactive menu interface, with all data persisted to text files for session continuity.

### Core Functional Areas

| Area | Capabilities |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Station Management** | Load station data, add new stations, locate nearest station by coordinates, safely close stations, remove malfunctioning ports. |
| **Customer Operations** | Auto-register customers, assign vehicles to appropriate ports, manage FIFO waiting queues, calculate dynamic pricing. |
| **Monitoring & Reporting** | Display system status, generate port statistics, track customer rankings, monitor charging sessions. |
| **Automated Maintenance**| Release ports after timeout, process waiting queues, maintain data consistency. |

## System Architecture

The EasyCharge system follows a modular, layered architecture. The diagram below illustrates the core entities of the system‚ÄîStations, Customers, Ports, and Queues‚Äîand their relationships. It also highlights the data structures chosen for performance optimization.

## Building and Running the Project

To compile and run the application, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [project-directory-name]
    ```

3.  **Compile the project:**
    The `Makefile` will create `build/` and `bin/` directories and place the final executable inside `bin/`.
    ```bash
    make all
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    ./bin/easycharge
    ```

5.  **Clean the project:**
    To remove all build artifacts, use the `clean` command.
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
