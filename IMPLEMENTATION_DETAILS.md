# Implementation Details

This document provides comprehensive documentation of the core system modules and their implementations. It covers the primary C source files, function implementations, data structure operations, and module interactions that form the foundation of the charging station management system.

## Core Implementation Architecture
The system is implemented as a modular C application with distinct separation of concerns. A layered architecture with clear interfaces separates system control, business logic, and data management.

## Application Lifecycle and Control Flow
The main application implements a robust lifecycle with initialization, a main operation loop, and a cleanup phase. The control flow uses defensive programming with input validation and automatic data persistence after state-modifying operations.

## System Data Management Layer
A comprehensive data management strategy handles loading, persistence, and memory cleanup through dedicated system functions.

#### System Function Responsibilities
| Function | Parameters | Purpose | Memory Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `loadFiles()` | `Station**`, `tCar**` | Initialize BSTs from files | Allocates memory for all entities |
| `updateFiles()`| `Station*`, `tCar*` | Persist current state to files | No memory change |
| `displayMenu()`| `None` | Show interactive menu | No memory impact |
| `exitSys()` | `Station*`, `tCar*` | Clean shutdown with memory free | Deallocates all system memory |

## Menu Dispatch and Operation Integration
The system uses a menu-driven interface that dispatches user requests to the appropriate modules while managing data persistence automatically. The system categorizes operations to trigger file updates only when necessary, optimizing performance.

## Error Handling and Input Validation
Robust error handling and input validation ensure system stability. The system prevents infinite loops from invalid character input by checking the return value of `scanf` and clearing the input buffer on failure.
